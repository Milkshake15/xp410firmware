# xp410firmware
I'm attempting to reverse engineer an Epson XP-410''s firmware to see if it's possible to get the printer running as part of a home brew powder/binder 3d printer.

I'm new to github and not a strong programmer, but I figure someone may be interested in helping or looking through what I have so far.
